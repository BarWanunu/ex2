## Tests


## Our workflow

At first we divided the missions between us and updated it in the Jira. <br>
We created the tests for the program and by them we built the components with different and specific roles for each component. <br>
During our work we checked after every little detail we changed that our app behavior is as we expected. <br> 
When everything worked as we expected we upload our program. <br>
